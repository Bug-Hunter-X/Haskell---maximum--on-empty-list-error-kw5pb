The solution involves adding a check to ensure the list is not empty before applying the `maximum` function.

```haskell
import Data.Maybe (fromMaybe)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let numbers = []
  let maxNumber = fromMaybe 0 (maximumMay numbers)
  print maxNumber

maximumMay :: (Ord a) => [a] -> Maybe a
maximumMay [] = Nothing
maximumMay xs = Just (maximum xs)
```
This corrected version utilizes the `maximumMay` function from Data.Maybe which returns `Nothing` for an empty list.  The `fromMaybe` function then provides a default value (0 in this case) if the list is empty. This prevents a runtime error and provides a more robust solution.
